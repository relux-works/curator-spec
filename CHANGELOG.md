# Changelog

All notable protocol changes are recorded here. Versions follow Semantic
Versioning for the complete specification set.

## 1.0.0-rc.1 - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Split normative protocol core, registry, manager profile, and conformance
  documents from the implementation-specific Curator CLI guide.
- Draft 2020-12 JSON Schemas for every versioned wire object and HTTP response.
- Authoritative positive and negative conformance vectors with deterministic
  regeneration.
- Compatibility, security, governance, and release policies.
- Cross-platform CI and shared Go/Python conformance gates.
- A repository-pinned SSH signer allowlist verified by release CI for both the
  release tag and its target commit.
- GitHub Actions dependencies pinned to verified full commit IDs.

### Changed

- Declared machine-home paths, command names, global environment variables,
  cache layouts, and managed comment text implementation-specific.
- Replaced implementation-oracle conformance language with schema, prose, and
  vector authority.
- Defined Curator Canonical JSON 1, complete snapshot validation, Merkle byte
  layout, bundle authentication, HTTP errors and limits, and key rotation.
- Defined deterministic closure ordering and portable Windows path rules.
- Added shared identifier, expanded path, source-identity, and signed-number
  rejection vectors.
- Clarified that project aliases are operator-facing Unicode labels while
  canonical registry source identities remain whitespace-free lowercase-host
  values of bounded length.
- Made paginated record envelopes tolerant of individually malformed object
  candidates so federation can ignore one bad record without dropping a page.
- Aligned manager and system configuration schemas with both implementations:
  strict unknown fields, portable matching aliases, registry key and URL
  validation, explicit defaults, and configurable cache/snapshot time bounds.
- Removed the undefined per-registry `required` flag; strict registry policy is
  the protocol 1.0 fail-closed mechanism for unknown artifacts.

### Compatibility

- Existing deployed wire filenames and `.agents/` layout are preserved.
- The signed JSON profile preserves bytes for all valid pre-RC registry
  objects; previously ambiguous numeric and string forms are now rejected.
