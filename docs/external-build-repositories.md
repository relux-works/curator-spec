# External build repository authoring and operations

This guide is informative. The normative contracts are
[`protocol/core.md`](../protocol/core.md),
[`profiles/manager.md`](../profiles/manager.md), and
[`decisions/0005-external-build-repositories.md`](../decisions/0005-external-build-repositories.md).

## Package authoring

Schema 7 keeps repository identity in `build_repositories`, the command name in
the consuming manifest, and logical target selection in the repository-root
`curator-build.json` descriptor:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 7,
  "capabilities": {},
  "build_repositories": {
    "golden-tools": {
      "git": "https://github.com/example/golden-tools.git",
      "locked_commit": {
        "object_format": "sha1",
        "hex": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
      },
      "tag": "v1.4.0"
    }
  },
  "commands": {
    "golden-tool": {
      "type": "build",
      "driver": "go-repository-v1",
      "repository": "golden-tools",
      "target": "golden-tool"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "targets": {
    "golden-tool": {
      "driver": "go-repository-v1",
      "build_root": ".",
      "source_dir": "cmd/golden-tool"
    }
  }
}
```

Use a full lowercase SHA-1 or SHA-256 commit ID. A tag is an additional exact
assertion, not the source lock: the manager fetches only that tag and requires
its terminal commit to equal `locked_commit`. Without a tag, the manager
fetches only the full locked object ID. There is no branch, abbreviated-ID,
all-refs, direct-ID fallback for tagged sources, or repository-selected
refspec.

The descriptor cannot name an executable, output, argv, environment, hook,
plugin, generator, signer, or fallback. The command key determines the
manager-derived artifact basename. External repository files never enter agent
context or the consuming skill runtime copy.

## Development substitutions

`Skillfile.dev.json` schema 2 may replace one declared repository with either a
network ref or an ordinary local Git worktree:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "substitutions": {},
  "build_repository_substitutions": {
    "golden-skill": {
      "golden-tools": {
        "path": "../golden-tools"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A local substitution is deliberately narrow. It must be a non-bare worktree
with a direct, link-free `.git` directory, files-format refs, admitted config,
and complete SHA-1 or SHA-256 loose objects or pack-v2/v3 plus index-v2 pairs.
Gitfiles, linked worktrees, reftable, alternates, replace refs, grafts,
promisor/partial-clone state, optional pack sidecars, links, and special files
fail closed. The manager parses and inertly copies source Git data; it never
executes source hooks, filters, helpers, Git LFS, upload-pack, or maintenance.

Declared and effective identities both remain in receipt v2 and marker v3.
Strict audit rejects substitutions. Advisory audit discloses and independently
audits the exact effective snapshot.

## Operator requirements

Before enabling `go-repository-v1`, an operator supplies:

- a fingerprinted Git release family covered by the rc.5 vectors;
- HTTPS TLS and credential policy, or a trusted OpenSSH client, known-hosts
  state, authentication state, and manager wrapper;
- protected snapshot, receipt, artifact, journal, and marker storage;
- resource limits at least as permissive as the shared-suite fixtures; and
- an audit policy that treats the consuming skill and every effective external
  repository as separate subjects.

Every operation proves the full raw-object snapshot, scans every blob for the
pinned Git LFS parser family, materializes and validates exact regular-file
bytes, computes the build-source digest, and audits that frozen snapshot before
artifact-cache lookup or compiler execution. This order also applies to a
claimed cache hit, cache miss, source-covering dry run, repair, and
coverage-claiming audit. Dry-run and audit-only paths publish no mutation;
syntax-only validation remains a separate non-covering operation.

Receipt v2 `cache_key` is recomputed as SHA-256 of CCJ-1 `input`, and marker v3
`receipt_sha256` is recomputed from the complete CCJ-1 receipt. Consumers must
verify both relationships rather than accepting the fields as opaque digests.

Syntax-only offline validation may return
`build_repository_unverified_offline` without claiming source coverage.
Install, update, repair, and coverage-claiming audit fail
`build_repository_source_unavailable` before mutation when exact source and
audit evidence are unavailable. Read-only status does not contact the remote
merely to re-test a tag.

The first driver revision performs no post-build signing. A package signing
request fails `build_repository_package_signing_forbidden`; a platform that
requires local signing fails `build_repository_signer_policy_unsupported`
until a separately reviewed signer profile exists.

## Shared-suite consumption and claims

The executable corpus is under
[`conformance/v1`](../conformance/v1). Implementations receive that directory
through `CURATOR_CONFORMANCE_ROOT` and must execute every applicable case
without skip or xfail. The exact candidate protocol pin is
`candidate_protocol_pin.manifest_sha256` in
[`release/1.0.0-rc.5.json`](../release/1.0.0-rc.5.json); consumers must compare
that value with the SHA-256 of `conformance/v1/manifest.json`.

Schema-valid claim-v3 bytes are not platform evidence. Emit a driver/platform
tuple only after immutable native evidence proves that exact tuple against the
pinned suite. This candidate emits no claim. macOS and Windows external-driver
qualification remains pending downstream native runs, and Linux is explicitly
excluded until `TASK-260728-1skseh` passes.
